## Abstract <a name="abstract"></a>

In this report, the trends of 6 dark net markets (DNMs) are analyzed using the Kilos dataset.

We analyzed their top vendors and possible reasons for their performances, such as user ratings.
The Kilos dataset is then augmented with the Agora dataset to categorize each vendor according to the
type of items/services sold. With the categorization of vendors, we can identify which vendors are
prevalent in each sub-category.
Lastly, the Kilos dataset is verified using 2 other datasets, the Silk Road 2 dataset and the Darknet Market
Cocaine dataset. Despite being collected at different times, these datasets share a small number of
vendors. The ratings of these common vendors are used to determine if there are any discrepancies with
the Kilos dataset

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this report, analysis of the 6 DNMs (from the Kilos dataset) have revealed the following.
1. Overall sales (for each category and DNM site) peaked in the September 2019 to December 2019
time period.
2. The top 3 DNM sites that dominate the categories are:
a. Empire - Counterfeits, Forgeries, Information, Services, Drug Paraphernalia
b. Cannazon - Tobacco, Drugs
c. Apollon - Weapons
3. Most of the top vendors specialized in their own category of items with the exception of
sexyhomer. sexyhomer is involved in the Services, Information and Counterfeits categories.
4. Vendor ratings do have an impact on their lifespans.
5. Vendor ratings only have an impact on bitcoin earnings for the top earning vendors.
6. There are 23 vendors that have migrated from Silk Road 2 (in 2014) to the current 6 DNMs (in 2019).
With these insights, it is hoped law enforcement efforts can be focused on the appropriate DNMs according to their needs. For instance, if there is a need to target Drugs, the Cannazon site can be closely monitored. The top vendors for Drugs can also be focused on and new vendors can be identified, by
analyzing their review ratings.

Furthermore, by understanding the overall trends of the DRMs, it can be ascertained when are the peak periods of traffic. Hence, law enforcement efforts can increase their surveillance during these peak
periods.

Lastly, law enforcement agencies can increase surveillance on vendors that are of particular interest.

These vendors could be the top performing vendors or those with longest lifespans or those that had migrated over from other DNMs, like Silk Road 2
