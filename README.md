# cyber-security-modular-master-projects
This repository contains the projects submitted for the Modular Master (Cyber Security)

The projects are as follows: 
1. [Data Analytics Project](https://github.com/AhmadHatziq/cyber-security-modular-master-projects/tree/main/Data%20Analytics%20Project) - creating a network intrusion detection machine learning model using the NSL-KDD dataset. 
2. [Network Anomaly Detection Project](https://github.com/AhmadHatziq/cyber-security-modular-master-projects/tree/main/Network%20Anomaly%20Detection%20Project) - creating a lab network environment hosting various services (SQL server, Flask web application, FTP etc), generating benign and malicious traffic, training a network intrusion detection machine learning model using the generated dataset, deploying the final model as a CLI app.
3. [Dark Web Analysis Project](https://github.com/AhmadHatziq/cyber-security-modular-master-projects/tree/main/Dark%20Web%20Analysis%20Project) - analyzing dark web datasets and identifying key trends and observations.
4. [Email Spam Filtering Project](https://github.com/AhmadHatziq/cyber-security-modular-master-projects/tree/main/Email%20Spam%20Filtering%20Project) - testing 2 email spam classifiers (Apache SpamAssassin and Rspamd) on an email spam dataset, analyzing how these email spam classifiers function.
5. [Malicious URL Classification Project](https://github.com/AhmadHatziq/cyber-security-modular-master-projects/tree/main/Malicious%20URL%20Classifier%20Project) - training a malicious URL classification model using ensemble learning (3 seperate models are trained using 3 different datasets) and deploying final binary classification model as a Chrome extension.
